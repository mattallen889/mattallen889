### Hello!
-----------------------------------------------
## Who is mattallen889
I am an applied computing and informatics student at the University Nebraska of Omaha with a minor in business 🖥. Combined with my business minor, I have an understanding of both sides. While studying abroad in Milan, Italy 🇮🇹, I quickly gained a love for traveling ✈. In addition, I love playing video games 🎮, cooking 🍳, making music 🎵, and hiking 🏔. Ask me about these topics and I'll talk your ear off. 

## Work
I love working alongside a diverse team. I do not think I could make it if I couldn't socialize and bounce ideas off team members 💬. Currently I work in the restaurant business where I am able to fulfill this need and socialize with all different kinds of people. I love solving unique problems that arise and finding effective solutions with haste. 

## School
As stated above, I am in the IS&T program at UNO. This program is giving me the flexibility and ability to learn a variety of different topics that a specified major may not offer. I have learned coding in different languages like Python and C, statistical methods, software and hardware construction, and data analysis. These variety of different classes have given me thr opportunity to dip my toes into a variety of topics.
